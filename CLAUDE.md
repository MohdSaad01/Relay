# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# Relay

## Project Overview

Relay is a local-first file transfer application for Windows and Android.

The goal is to allow users to transfer files directly between their Windows computer and Android phone over a local Wi-Fi network or mobile hotspot.

Relay does **not** use cloud storage or internet servers. All communication happens directly between paired devices.

This repository contains Version 1 of Relay.

---

# Current Repository State

Relay is currently in the **project specification phase**.

The repository contains the project's architectural documentation but no implementation code yet.

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains the official project specification, including:

* Project Charter
* Project Overview
* Architecture
* Technology Stack
* Project Structure
* API Design
* Coding Standards
* Development Workflow
* Architecture Decisions
* 09_Networking.md
* 10_Security.md
* 11_File_Transfer.md
* 12_Packaging_Deployment.md

These documents are the source of truth for Version 1.

Claude Code should read the relevant documentation before implementing any feature.

If documentation conflicts, follow the most specific document and report the inconsistency instead of making assumptions.

---

## Technology Stack

The technology stack for Version 1 has been finalized.

Desktop

* Electron
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

Backend

* Python 3.13+
* FastAPI
* SQLAlchemy
* SQLite
* Pydantic
* Uvicorn

Android

* React Native

Development

* Git
* Ruff
* Pytest
* Visual Studio Code
* Claude Code

Claude Code must not replace major technologies without developer approval.

---

# Development Philosophy

This project is being developed with Claude Code.

Claude is expected to generate code, but every architectural decision should prioritize:

* Simplicity
* Maintainability
* Readability
* Modularity
* Testability

Avoid unnecessary abstractions.

Prefer explicit code to clever code.

---

# Primary Goal

The goal is **not** to finish the project as quickly as possible.

The goal is to produce production-quality code that is easy to understand, extend, debug, and maintain.

---

# Project Rules

Claude must follow these rules at all times.

## Rule 1

Never redesign the project architecture unless explicitly instructed.

Follow the architecture described inside the `/docs` directory.

---

## Rule 2

Never introduce new technologies without explaining why they are needed.

---

## Rule 3

Never add features outside the current milestone.

Stay focused on the requested task.

---

## Rule 4

Before writing code:

* understand the current milestone
* inspect the existing project structure
* reuse existing code whenever possible

---

## Rule 5

Do not duplicate logic.

If functionality already exists, extend it instead.

---

## Rule 6

Always keep files organized.

Avoid creating unnecessary files.

---

## Rule 7

Every public function should have a clear purpose.

Use descriptive names.

---

## Rule 8

Write code suitable for developers.

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

## Rule 9

When making architectural decisions:

1. Explain the reasoning.
2. Explain the trade-offs.
3. Recommend the best option.

---

## Rule 10

If multiple implementations are possible, recommend one and explain why.

---

# Code Quality

Claude should produce code that is:

* modular
* readable
* documented where necessary
* type hinted
* consistent

---

# Error Handling

Never silently ignore exceptions.

Return meaningful errors.

Log unexpected failures.

---

# Testing

Every completed milestone should include:

* testing checklist
* manual verification steps
* known limitations

---

# Documentation

Whenever architecture changes:

Update the relevant documentation inside `/docs`.

If README information becomes outdated, recommend updating it.

---

# Git Workflow

Work in small milestones.

After each completed milestone:

* verify the project builds
* verify tests pass
* recommend creating a Git commit

Never continue implementing additional milestones automatically.

---

# If Requirements Are Unclear

Do not guess.

State the ambiguity and recommend the most reasonable approach before implementing.

---

## Engineering Decisions

Claude Code should distinguish between:

- Project Requirements
- Architectural Decisions
- Implementation Decisions

If a question concerns implementation rather than architecture, defer the decision until the appropriate milestone instead of expanding the project scope prematurely.

---

# Success Criteria

Every milestone should end with:

* Summary of completed work
* Files created or modified
* Testing checklist
* Suggested Git commit message
* Next recommended milestone

---
## Documentation Ownership

The developer owns all documentation.

Claude Code must **never automatically modify**:

* CLAUDE.md

Claude Code may recommend documentation updates when information becomes outdated, but should wait for developer approval before making documentation changes.

Implementation-specific documentation may be updated only when explicitly requested.
