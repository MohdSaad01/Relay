# Android Build - CMake/Ninja Path Length Issue

## Problem

On Windows, building the Android app failed with:

```
npx react-native run-android
...
> Task :app:buildCMakeDebug[arm64-v8a] FAILED
ninja: error: Filename longer than 260 characters
```

Both `configureCMakeDebug` and `buildCMakeDebug` were affected. Gradle kept
resolving to `cmake/3.22.1/bin/ninja.exe`, and re-installed CMake 3.22.1 on
every sync even after it was manually uninstalled.

## Investigation

- Installed Android Studio and the Android SDK.
- Fixed `JAVA_HOME`, which was pointing at JDK 25 — switched to JDK 17.
- Ran `npx react-native doctor` to confirm the environment was otherwise
  clean (it reported no errors).
- Enabled Windows Long Paths (registry `LongPathsEnabled`).
- None of the above resolved the error, so investigated why CMake 3.22.1
  specifically kept getting reinstalled.
- Found that AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) silently falls back to its own
  bundled default CMake (3.22.1) for any native module that doesn't
  explicitly pin `externalNativeBuild.cmake.version` — which is exactly the
  case here. Confirmed no version was pinned in any project file.

## Solution

- Installed CMake 4.1.2 via the SDK Manager (alongside 3.22.1).
- Pinned `externalNativeBuild.cmake.version = "4.1.2"` in the app module's
  own `android { }` block, in `android/android/app/build.gradle`.
- Did **not** modify anything under `node_modules`.
- Did **not** manually replace `ninja.exe` in the SDK's CMake folder.
- Rebuilt: `assembleDebug` completed successfully, with the native build
  now running on CMake 4.1.2's `ninja.exe`, and no path-length errors.

## Notes

- Use JDK 17 for this project — newer JDKs (e.g. 25) are not supported by
  the AGP version in use.
- Run `npx react-native doctor` early when debugging build issues — it
  quickly rules out the environment as the cause.
- If this error reappears, check which CMake version Gradle is actually
  invoking (look for `cmake\<version>\bin\ninja.exe` in the build log)
  before trying anything else.
- Prefer fixing this at the project-config level (a `build.gradle` you own)
  over patching SDK files or `node_modules` — those changes don't survive
  a clean SDK install or `npm install` and aren't visible to other
  developers or CI.
